### Introduction
I am DownloadPizza, I am currently learning stuffs at a higher technical school in Austria.
I like to work with Kotlin, Rust and a lot of other stuff.
Only think I kind of dislike right now is Android apps in Java/Kt as I was too lazy to learn it so far. Also I try to 
avoid vanilla JS wherever I can, but im very happy with TS.
